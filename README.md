Automatic selection of SFTC matchups with Python Data Scraping/Analysis

The primary goal of this project is to create an automated program with an impeccable ability to pick the sports matchups posed daily on ESPN's Streak for the Cash competition (streak.espn.com).

__About SFTC__:
In this free competition, users may win cash prizes up to $25,000 by either:

1. Having the longest streak of correct picks out of all players for the month
2. Accumulating the maxmimum number of correct picks for the month

There are a variety of matchups that players may choose from, spanning all common sports:
* Picking the winning team/player (this is the most common pick)
* Picking the winning "side" of a prop bet, which may only last a brief portion of the game
  * (Ex. Which QB will have more yards in the first half?)

__Rules__:
* Players may not register multiple accounts
* Only 1 pick may be made at a time
* __Note:__ A player may "forfeit" their pick if they wish to make another selection before their current matchup ends

__Objectives of the project:__

1. Identify a winning strategy: Develop multiple programs with the 2 objectives listed above
2. Utilize the best information available, including:
  1. Other SFTC analytics sites (streakedge.com)
  2. Live monitoring of ongoing picks (to possibly forfeit)
  3. Betting lines/Sports analytics sites publishing predictions (ex. FiveThirtyEight)
  4. *Stretch*: Internal modeling/simulations
3. Identify patterns of favorable matchups
